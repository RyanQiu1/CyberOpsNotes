## PII 
A subset of PII is protected health information (PHI). The medical community creates and maintains electronic medical records (EMRs) that contain PHI. In the U.S., handling of PHI is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In the European Union the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) protects a broad range of personal information in including health records.

Personal security information (PSI) is another type of PII. This information includes usernames, passwords, and other security-related information that individuals use to access information or services on the network. According to a 2019 report by Verizon, the second most common way that threat actors breached a network was by using stolen PSI.
