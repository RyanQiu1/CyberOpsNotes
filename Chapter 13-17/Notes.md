- Fast flux, double IP flux, and domain generation algorithms are used by cybercrimals to attack DNS servers and affect DNS services. Fast flux is a technique used to hide phishing and malware delivery sites behind a quickly-changing network of compromised DNS hosts (bots within botnets). The double IP flux technique rapidly changes the hostname to IP address mappings and the authoritative name server. Domain generation algorithms randomly generate domain names to be used as rendezvous points.

- A gratuitous ARP is often sent when a device first boots up to inform all other devices on the local network of the MAC address of the new device.

- A computer can have a worm installed through an email attachment, an executable program file, or a Trojan Horse. The worm attack not only affects one computer, but replicates to other computers. What the worm leaves behind is the payload--the code that results in some action.

- MAC address spoofing is used to bypass security measures by allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate host device, usually for the purpose of collecting network traffic.

- Optional Layer 3 information about fragmentation, security, and mobility is carried inside of extension headers in an IPv6 packet. The next header field of the IPv6 header acts as a pointer to these optional extension headers if they are present.

- Fuzzers are tools used by threat actors when attempting to discover the vulnerabilities of a computer system. Examples of fuzzers include Skipfish, Wapiti, and W3af.

- SPAN is a Cisco technology used by network administrators to monitor suspicious traffic or to capture traffic to be analyzed. It mirrors traffic that passes through a switch port or VLAN to another port for traffic analysis.

- NetFlow collects basic information about the packet flow, not the flow data itself.NetFlow does not capture the entire contents of a packet. Instead, NetFlow collects metadata, or data about the flow, not the flow data itself. NetFlow information can be viewed with tools such as nfdump and FlowViewer.
