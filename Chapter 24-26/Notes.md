# Chapter 24-26

- Hackers may try to block clients from sending data to the syslog server, manipulate or erase logged data, or manipulate the software used to transmit messages between the clients and the server. Syslog-ng is the next generation of syslog and it contains improvements to prevent some of the exploits.

- The echo ICMP packet should not be allowed inbound on an interface. The echo-reply should be allowed so that when an internal device pings an external device, the reply is allowed to return.

- ICMP traffic from inside the company is also a threat. Some varieties of malware use ICMP packets to transfer files from infected hosts to threat actors via ICMP tunneling.

-  Sguil makes Snort-generated alerts readable and searchable.

- Like session data, statistical data is about network traffic. Statistical data is created through the analysis of other forms of network data.

- Network behavior analysis (NBA) and network behavior anomaly detection (NBAD) are approaches to network security monitoring that use advanced analytical techniques to analyze NetFlow or IPFIX network telemetry data.

- The Network Analysis Module of the Cisco Prime Infrastructure system and Wireshark have GUI interfaces and can display full packet captures. The tcpdump tool is a command-line packet analyzer.

- The HEADER section of the message contains the timestamp. If the timestamp is preceded by the period (.) or asterisk (*) symbols, a problem is indicated with NTP.

- Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) devices provide a wide range of functionalities for security monitoring. WSA effectively acts as a web proxy. It logs all inbound and outbound transaction information for HTTP traffic.

- The Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) acts as a web proxy for an enterprise network. WSA can provide many types of logs related to web traffic security including ACL decision logs, malware scan logs, and web reputation filtering logs. The Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) is a tool to monitor most aspects of email delivery, system functioning, antivirus, antispam operations, and blacklist and whitelist decisions. The Cisco ASA is a firewall appliance. The Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC) system combines multiple technologies to recognize, analyze, and control over 1000 applications.

- A retrospective analysis can help in tracking the behavior of the malware from the identification point forward

- OSSEC is a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) that is integrated into Security Onion and actively monitors host system operation.



What is the purpose for data reduction as it relates to NSM? Network Security Monitoring (NSM)
- The amount of network traffic that is collected by packet captures and the number of log file entries and alerts that are generated by network and security devices can be enormous. For this reason, it is important to identify the NSM-related data that should be gathered. This process is called data reduction.


- OSSEC is a HIDS integrated into the Security Onion and uses rules to detect changes in host-based parameters like the execution of software processes, changes in user privileges, registry modifications, among many others. OSSEC rules will trigger events that occurred on the host, including indicators that malware may have interacted with the OS kernel. Bro, Snort, and Suricata are examples of NIDS systems.


- Dashboards provide a combination of data and visualizations designed to improve the access of individuals to large amounts of information. Kibana includes the capability of designing custom dashboards. In addition, other tools that are included in Security Onion, such as Squert, provide a visual interface to NSM data.

- The MITRE Framework uses stored information on attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) as part of threat defense and attack attribution. This is done by mapping the steps in an attack to a matrix of generalized tactics and describing the techniques that are used in each tactic. These sources of information create models that assist in the ability to attribute a threat.

- mapping the steps in an attack to a matrix of generalized tactics


- In the installation phase of the Cyber Kill Chain, the threat actor establishes a back door into the system to allow for continued access to the target. Among other measures, using HIPS to alert or block on common installation paths and auditing endpoints to discover abnormal file creations can help block a potential back door creation.


- In the command and control phase of the Cyber Kill Chain, the threat actor establishes command and control (CnC) with the target system. With the two-way communication channel, the threat actor is able to issue commands to the malware software installed on the target.

- The meta-feature element results are used to delineate what the adversary gained from the intrusion event.

- NIST defines four phases in the incident response process life cycle. It is in the containment, eradication, and recovery phase that evidence is gathered to resolve an incident and to help with subsequent investigations.

In the detection and analysis phase of the NIST incident response process life cycle, the CSIRT should immediately perform an initial analysis to determine the scope of the incident, such as which networks, systems, or applications are affected; who or what originated the incident; and how the incident is occurring.

- GPL - source fire
- VRT - Rules by cisco talos
- ET - open source rules

# Technologies and Protocols

Syslog typically listen on UDP port 514
- syslog-ng (next generation)

NTP uses UDP port 123

Threat actors have been known to use NTP systems to direct DDoS attacks through vulnerabilities in client or server software

DNS

Cisco Umbrella Passive DNS service can be used to block these requests

In kibana, zeek hunting can be used to display info on the file


# Digital Forensics and Incident analysis and response

NITS four phases

Collection - Identification of potential sources of forensic data and acquisition, handling and storage of that data
Examination - Assessing and extracting relevant info from collected data
Analysis - Drawing conclusions from the data and correlation of data from multiple sources
Reporting - Preparing and presenting information that resulted from the analysis phase


Types of evidence
-> Direct evidence
-> Indirect evidence
-> Best evidence - storage device
-> Corroborating evidence - evidence supports an assertion that is developed from best evidence

Evidence collection order
-> Volatile to Non-volatile

Chain of custody
-> Involves collection, handling and secure storage of evidence

Data integrity
-> Timestamps
-> Work on the copy
-> Need hash the copy

Preservation

Attack attribution
-> TTP
-> Attacker follows a pattern

MITRE ATT&CK Framework

Delivery
-> Adversary Tactics
Launch malware at target
1. Direct against web servers
2. Indirect delivery through

The diamond model of intrusion analysis
-> Adversary - Parties responsible for intrusion
-> Capability - Tool or technique used by the adversary to attack the victim
-> Infrastructure - Network paths used by the adversary to establish and maintain command and control over their capabilities
-> Victim - target of the attack

Meta-features expand the model slightly to include the important elements: Timestamp, phase, result, direction, methodology and resources

NIST Incident response plan

NIST incident response life cycle
1. Preparation - The members of the CSIRT are trained in how to respond to an incident
2. Detection and Analysis - CSIRT quickly identifies, analyses and validates an incident

Scoping
Incident notification, inform appropiate stakeholders and outside parties

3. Containment, Eradication and Recovery - CSIRT implements procedures to contain the threat, eradicate the impact on organisational assets and use backups to restore data and software

Containment Strategy
Evidence
Attacker identification
Eradication, recovery and remediation
4. Post-Incident Activities
- CSIRT documents how the incident was handled, recommends changes for future response and specifies how to avoid a reoccurence

Lessons-based hardening
-> Review the effectiveness of incident handling process
-> Identify necessary hardening needed for existing security controls and practices

Detection and Analysis
- Attack vectors : Web emails


Retention
1. Prosecution
All evidence should be retained until after all legal actions have been completed
2. Data type
An organisation may specify that specific types of data should be kept for a specific period of time
3. Cost
